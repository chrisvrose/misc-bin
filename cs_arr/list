Q1)WAP to  convert each element of an array in binary and store the result in string type array.
Q2)WAP to replace each  element of an array by adding 1 in each digit of Number.
For Example ->int []arr={12,45,897,560} then new array will be {23,56,908,671} .
Q3)WAP to replace each digit of a number inside an array by next prime number.If No Next Prime then replace by Previous Prime Number.

For Example ->int []arr={123,567,895,220} then new array will be {235,775,777,332} .
Q4)WAP to sort first half elements of an array in ascending order and second half elements of an array in descending order.

For Example ->int []arr={12,897,56,45,22,45,650,432} then new array will be {12,45,56,897,650,432,45,22} .

Q5)WAP to keep track of all the repeated elements together inside an array.
For Example ->int []arr={1,2,3,2,2,3,1,5,99,88,99,88,9,3,1,2,9} then new 
array will be {1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,5,99,99,88,88,9,9} .

Q6)WAP to input a decimal number find the sum of digits for the whole number parts and 
Multiplication of digits for the decimal part.
For Example-> A decimal has two parts:
(a) Whole number part
(b) Decimal part
125.765 Final result is 8 (Sum of whole Number part 125) and 210 (Multiplication of digits for the decimal part  765).

Q7)WAP to replace each number of an array by sum of all the numbers behind that .
For example->int []arr={12,8,21,25,9} then 12 will be replaced by sum of the number 1 to 11 ,21 will be replaced by sum of the number 1 to 20 etc.

Q8)WAP to input user name and password and must ensure username contains only alphabates 
  and password must contains atleast one  special symbol and also ensure password length must be greater than user name and atleast 5 character.

Q9)WAP to replace each  element of an array by LCM of subsequent two numbers.
For Example->int []arr={20,25,60,80,26,70,50,21} then replace 20 by LCM of 25,60 ,replace 50 by LCM of 21 and 20  ,replace 21 by LCM of 20 and 25.

Q 10)WAP to input a string and replace each character of this string by Unicode.
For example->”abc” then “979899”
